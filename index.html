      <div class="title">Welcome to SOMC Simulator 2018</div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>
          The year is 20XX. Found guilty for embezzling SorosBucks from the r/neoliberal treasury, MrDannyOcean has stepped down from
          his position as SOMC chairman. With nobody to lead, the SOMC has descended into chaos. Weeks of expansionary policy
          combined with lax moderation has turned the once venerable discussion thread into a battleground of drama and nuanceless
          takes. Now more than ever, the neoliberal project requires solid leadership, someone who can restore the tarnished
          community into its former greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          4Xth President of the United States Ben S. Bernanke has nominated you as the new chairman of the SOMC; despite opposition,
          you were narrowly confirmed 51 to 50, with Vice President Yellen casting the tie-breaking vote. Today is your first
          day as the leader of the international neoliberal community. Your three-part mandate: foster perfect neutrality
          between partisan lines, transparency, and the public opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of the world rest upon you, Chairman. Will your SOMC foster a new golden age of neoliberalism, or will excessive
          partisanship and incivility bury the center once and for all?
